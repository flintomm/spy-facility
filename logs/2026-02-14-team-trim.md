# 2026-02-14 — Team Trim Log

## Summary
- Removed idle agents (Scout, Forge, Patch, Sentry) from the facility roster and data model.
- Kept Flint, Cipher, and Atlas — the only agents with shipped work and recorded memories.
- Added a "VACANT / RECRUITING" treatment for empty pods so the floorplan still looks intentional.
- Updated all UI lists, filters, and assignment menus to only reference the remaining agents.
- Tightened `/api/employee-status` to report just the active trio.
- Restarted `com.flint.spyservice` to load the new data + server changes.

## Files Touched
1. `data/agents.json`
   - Removed Scout/Forge/Patch/Sentry entries.
   - Synced EXP totals for Flint, Cipher, Atlas with latest awards.
2. `index.html`
   - Pruned agent config arrays and dropdowns to Flint/Cipher/Atlas.
   - Added vacant pod signage + updated system info counter with vacancy count.
   - Removed unused sprite references.
   - Updated mobile/desktop filters and assignment prompts to the new roster.
3. `server.js`
   - Trimmed active-status tracking to match the new roster.
4. `logs/2026-02-14-team-trim.md`
   - This log.

## Verification
- `curl http://localhost:8080/api/employee-status` now returns only Flint, Cipher, Atlas.
- Facility renders three active desks plus clearly marked vacant pods; bottom bar shows `PODS: 3/8 (vacant 5)`.
- Service relaunched via `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/com.flint.spyservice`.
