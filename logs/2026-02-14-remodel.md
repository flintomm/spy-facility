# 2026-02-14 — Facility Remodel (Agent Quarters)

## Summary
- Removed the unused second row of pods (4 vacant desks) to free floor space.
- Added bespoke quarters for Flint, Cipher, and Atlas in the reclaimed area, each with a bed and character-specific decor.
- Updated corridor/floor layouts to account for the new residential wing.

## Details
1. **Pods & Layout**
   - `index.html`: trimmed POD generation to a single row (4 pods). The remaining pods still host workstations for the active team.
   - Added QUARTERS metadata (positions/sizes) and new helper drawings (beds, rug, dog bed, server rack, mini fridge, blueprint desk, bookshelf).
   - Added `drawQuarter` / `renderQuarters` plus supporting art functions. Corridors recalculated to include a walkway in front of the bedrooms.

2. **Character Rooms**
   - **Flint:** bed + Lucky’s dog bed + mission board (whiteboard) + plant.
   - **Cipher:** bed + glowing server rack + mini fridge/energy stash.
   - **Atlas:** bed + blueprint drafting desk + bookshelf + plant.

3. **Rendering**
   - `renderBackground` now calls `renderQuarters` after pods.
   - Vacant pods now removed entirely (no more placeholder desks), so the facility looks purpose-built instead of half-empty.

4. **Runtime**
   - Restarted `com.flint.spyservice` after the layout changes.

These changes keep the operations floor tight while showcasing each agent’s vibe when someone peeks at the facility.
